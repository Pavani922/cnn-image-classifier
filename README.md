CNN Image Classifier â€“ 5-Day Bootcamp Project

This project is a hands-on implementation of an image recognition system developed during a 5-day deep learning bootcamp. It walks through building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Dogs vs. Cats.

Features
- End-to-end image classification pipeline
- CNN architecture built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
- Supports multiple datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, Dogs vs. Cats
- Visualizations of training performance and predictions

Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Colab notebook with all code and explanations
- `datasets/`: (Optional) Folder for training/testing images
- `models/`: (Optional) Saved models for reuse or deployment

Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib / NumPy

Results
- Training Accuracy: ~XX%
- Validation Accuracy: ~XX%
- Includes plots of loss/accuracy and sample predictions

How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload your dataset or use one of the built-in datasets
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model
